Briefing

Aliens have settled on earth and strangely enough, their alphabet is the exact same as ours. Their language is also very similar to ours with some very distinct and easy to compute differences.
Challenge

Take a string and output the alien's language equivalent. The translation works as such:

Swap all the vowels in the word with the corresponding:

  Vowel |   With
--------+--------
   a    |   obo
   e    |   unu
   i    |   ini
   o    |   api
   u    |   iki

You may also write another translator to translate Alien->English, this is optional however.
Examples

Input: Shaun
Output: Shoboikin

Input: Java
Output: Jobovobo

Input: Hello, World!
Output: Hunullapi, Wapirld!

If the vowel is capitalized then you capitalize the first letter..

Input: Alan
Output: Obolobon

Input: Australia
Output: Oboikistroboliniobo

Rules

    Standard loopholes apply
    Must work for text that contains new lines

    You can either write a function, lambda, or full program
